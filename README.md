# 🕵️‍♀️ FraudDetect-AI: A Hybrid ML + Rule-Based Fraud Detection System

**FraudDetect-AI** is a real-time fraud detection system that combines machine learning and rule-based logic to flag suspicious transactions. It features a Streamlit dashboard, explainable AI (SHAP), and a modular backend — all crafted for production-grade clarity and interview showcase readiness.
